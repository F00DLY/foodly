## Getting Started

1. Open two terminals, one for site and the other for server.

2. In the first terminal (site), run the following command to install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. In the second terminal (./server), run the following command to install server dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd server
   npm install
   ```

4. After installing dependencies, in the first terminal (root directory), run the following command to start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. In the second terminal (`./server` directory), run the following command to start the server:

   ```bash
   npm run start
